    <p>You should post a short HTML report (max 500 words) outlining your personal learning outcomes and the problems encountered and how you solved them. The report should be reachable at the URL:-

http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~<yourusername>/atwd/crimes/doc/index.html
The report must also link to all source code created (i.e *.phps files for line by line inspection and NOT simply executables) for the service (and any client code that cannot be easily inspected).
