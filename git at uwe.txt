using git on UWE system:
Look for git bash in the search
Go to git repo. 

push tfs repo to git hub with all information: git push -u https://<username>:<password>@github.com/Hazz223/<reponame>.git <branch name>

Git hub also allows private projects!

You can put two origins (maybe more) in the Remote part of the git config file. 
url = <url>
url = <url>
Everything will now be pushed to both!
